it takes a big zeal to discover oneself, but once done, it is more difficult to connect the expert , successful guy of your genre.
i realised this when i was preparing my jee that its not the engineering, but marketing which attracts , i took to hbs lectues.
needless to say hbs is the HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.
hbs got me through negotiation lectures but took a lot time to get to the great negotiation lecturer prof. deepak malhotra.
so be prepared.........
